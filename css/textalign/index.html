        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.

    <h3>Premiere</h3>
    <p>
        Iron Man is a businessman and entrepreneur who seeks to innovate and improve his technology,[6][104] both for society's benefit and his own.[105][106] Iron Man is one of many Marvel heroes with a genius-level intellect,[107] but his focus on societal application alongside hard science distinguishes him from other heroes.[107] The character is a futurist, and he works to identify solutions for problems that have yet to emerge. This preemptive problem-solving was a driving force in his organization of the Avengers and later in his support for the Superhero Registration Act during the Civil War event.[1

    <h3>Solo Series</h3>
    <p>Iron Man's heart injury was prominent in his early characterization, causing him to isolate himself so as not to reveal his injury or his secret identity.[10] This weakness was a threat to his autonomy and his masculinity.[122] As real-world medical technology made heart injuries less fatal, writers introduced neurological damage[123] and alcoholism as other medical weaknesses.[124][125] Despite this, Iron Man considers himself lucky and believes he lives "a good life," attributing this to his money, friendships, engineering skills, and recovering health.
